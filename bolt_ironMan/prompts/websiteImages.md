```

### Image 04: Holographic Workshop Interface Icon
**Filename:** 04-workshop-interface-icon.png
**Usage:** Feature section icon
**Dimensions:** 256x256px
**Prompt:**
```
Design a Stark-tech holographic interface icon that captures the essence of Tony's workshop controls. Create this icon at 256x256 pixels with sharp detail and clear visibility. The focal point is a series of floating, semi-transparent panels arranged in a JARVIS-inspired layout, rendered in luminous Arc Reactor Blue (#64F3FF). These panels appear to respond to gesture controls, with some tilted and others expanding as if being manipulated in 3D space. Hot Rod Red (#E3000B) accent lines trace the edges of each panel, with Mark III Gold (#FFB300) highlights at intersection points. The panels feature suit schematics and story creation tools, connected by flowing lines of energy. Multiple layers of transparency create an authentic Stark-tech holographic feel. The overall composition maintains the Iron Man aesthetic while incorporating particle effects and light refractions that suggest advanced Stark Industries technology.
```

### Image 05: Achievement Arc Reactor Icon
**Filename:** 05-achievement-icon.png
**Usage:** Feature section icon
**Dimensions:** 256x256px
**Prompt:**
```
Create a prestigious achievement icon based on the arc reactor design. Generate this icon at 256x256 pixels with precise detail and crisp edges. The center features a brilliant arc reactor core glowing in Arc Reactor Blue (#64F3FF), surrounded by concentric rings of Stark Industries Silver (#C5C5C5) that pulse with energy. Achievement indicators in Mark III Gold (#FFB300) circle the outer edge, suggesting completed missions and unlocked abilities. The design incorporates Hot Rod Red (#E3000B) accents that frame key achievements. Geometric patterns inspired by the Iron Man suit create structure and sophistication, while precisely placed glowing edges add dimension. Energy waves radiate outward from the central reactor in a symmetrical pattern, suggesting power and accomplishment.
