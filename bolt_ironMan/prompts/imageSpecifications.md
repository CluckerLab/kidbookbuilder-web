## Design Guidelines
1. All images should maintain a consistent tech aesthetic inspired by Iron Man/Stark tech
2. Use the established color palette exclusively:
   - Hot Rod Red (`#E3000B`)
   - Arc Reactor Blue (`#64F3FF`)
   - Mark III Gold (`#FFB300`)
   - Stark Industries Silver (`#C5C5C5`)
   - Workshop Steel (`#4A4A4A`)
   - Night Mode Black (`#121212`)

3. Include holographic elements where appropriate
4. Maintain high contrast for accessibility
5. Use gradients defined in color palette for glowing effects:
   - Arc Reactor Glow
   - Hot Rod Finish
   - Gold Armor

## Technical Specifications
1. Save all images in both WebP and PNG formats
2. Optimize for web performance while maintaining quality
3. Include appropriate metadata
4. Ensure all images are responsive and scale appropriately
5. Use appropriate compression settings:
   - PNG: 8-bit with alpha channel
   - WebP: Quality 85%, lossless for icons

## Animation Considerations (if applicable)
1. Arc reactor pulsing effects
2. Holographic interface movements
3. Energy flow animations
4. Suit assembly sequences
5. Achievement unlock effects

## Accessibility Requirements
1. All images must have appropriate alt text
2. Ensure sufficient contrast for overlaid text
3. Avoid rapid flashing or strobing effects
4. Provide static alternatives for any animated elements
